## Chapter 1. The First strike

In the dimly lit alleyways of Tokyo, where neon lights flickered between cracks in the broken city, shadows moved quietly. The air was thick with the stench of rain-soaked concrete and the residue of the night’s debauchery. Somewhere amidst the darkness, a phone rang. A man, shrouded in black, pulled it from his pocket, his face hidden beneath a hood, his expression unreadable.

He answered without a word. Silence echoed from the other end, but he waited, as he always did. It wasn’t his place to ask questions. Not anymore.

The voice finally came—a low, mechanical murmur, distorted to mask its owner’s identity. “There’s a job. Eliminate the target. Location and time are already in your inbox.”

The man’s breath remained steady. There was no need for clarification, no need for details. As a professional assassin, he never asked who or why. His only concern was when and how. His precision was unmatched, his reputation earned over years of clean, perfect kills.

“You’ve been paid,” the voice continued, the sound cold and detached. “The money is in your account. But understand this: if you fail, someone else will eliminate you before you even realize it.”

The line went dead.

The assassin stood still for a moment, staring into the black abyss around him. He wasn’t afraid—he never was. Failure had never been an option. He checked his account, and as promised, the payment was already there. The job was simple: eliminate the target and disappear into the night.

He made his way to the venue, a quiet, upscale restaurant tucked away in a part of the city reserved for those with power and influence. The target’s identity didn’t matter. They never did. In his line of work, attachments and curiosity were luxuries he couldn’t afford.

With calculated precision, he moved through the crowd, blending in as if he belonged. His eyes never wavered from the target once they were locked on. The target—a middle-aged man, oblivious to the death sentence that had already been passed—sipped a glass of wine, enjoying a quiet moment of indulgence.

It was over in seconds.

A quick, deadly strike. A flash of silver. The man’s glass shattered on the ground as his lifeless body slumped back into the chair. No screams, no chaos—just the cold efficiency of a professional hit.

The assassin wiped the dagger clean, leaving no trace of his presence behind. But this time, something different lingered in his mind. He had been ordered to leave a clue—something that felt unusual for such a discreet operation.

He pulled out a small card from his pocket, just as he had been instructed. It bore no name, no symbol, only a single line of cryptic text: “This is just the beginning. The algorithm has spoken”


He placed it next to the body, a final message from the shadowy figure who had given the order. It was a warning, not just to the dead man, but to everyone watching from behind the scenes. This was only the beginning.

With one last glance at the target, the assassin melted back into the shadows, unseen, unknown. His work here was done.

But in the darker corridors of power, the game was just starting. Somewhere in the city, systems were being activated, plans set in motion, and the algorithm—whatever it was—had already begun to weave its deadly web.

The night was thick with rain, a constant drumming on the neon-drenched streets of Tokyo’s underbelly. Each droplet turned the already gleaming city into a blurred mosaic of colors, an almost surreal landscape where dark alleys and glaring izakayas coexisted in uneasy harmony. Down in one of those alleys, past the rows of dimly lit pawnshops and seedy bars, the city’s more nefarious secrets lurked—just beneath the glossy, well-crafted surface of modern life.

Inside a grimy, smoke-filled bar, Detective Kenji Nakamura sat nursing a glass of whiskey, his eyes surveying the room with the detached interest of someone who’d seen too much. It was a typical night for him—a mix of cigarette smoke, low murmured conversations, and the occasional clatter of glasses. The dim light cast long shadows on the walls, where faded posters for long-forgotten bands and events clung like memories no one wanted to keep but didn’t quite have the heart to discard.

Kenji leaned back in his chair, his gaze narrowing as he took in the patrons. The regulars were there, as they always were—the broken and the bent, their lives charted by the number of drinks they could afford to lose themselves in. He took a slow sip from his glass, grimacing at the sting of cheap liquor. He wasn’t sure why he liked places like this. Maybe it was because, in a world obsessed with newness and technology, these places remained the same—stuck in their own brand of gritty nostalgia.

A phone rang. Its shrill tone shattered the bar’s ambiance, pulling Kenji from his thoughts. He checked the screen, recognizing the number immediately. It wasn’t a social call.

He exhaled, draining the last of his whiskey. “Here we go again,” he muttered to himself, throwing some yen on the counter and making his way out into the rain, the scent of the bar lingering on his coat as he left.

The crime scene was just a few blocks away, tucked in a neighborhood that didn’t make the tourism brochures. Kenji arrived, ducking under the police tape and stepping carefully through the puddles that had already begun to form around the chalk outline of the body. Flashing red and blue lights reflected off the wet pavement, casting eerie hues over the grim scene. Uniformed officers nodded as he passed, their faces hardening in the presence of the seasoned detective.

The victim lay sprawled out in the narrow alley, surrounded by discarded newspapers and a toppled trash can. He was middle-aged, dressed in an expensive suit that had been carelessly torn and stained with blood. His face was frozen in a grotesque grimace of shock—his life extinguished in a way that suggested the killer had taken their time. This wasn’t a random attack. This was personal.

Kenji knelt beside the body, his eyes narrowing as he took in the details. “Let me guess,” he said to no one in particular, “a tech mogul who thought playing with fire would keep him warm. Looks like someone finally did what his investors couldn’t—killed his career.”

The nearby officers stifled smirks, accustomed to Kenji’s dry humor. He was known for his sarcastic wit, a defense mechanism against the gruesome realities of his work. But beneath the cynicism was a sharp mind that rarely missed a thing.

Kenji reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a pair of gloves, snapping them on with practiced ease. He moved closer to the body, inspecting the pattern of the wounds. The first thing that struck him was their precision. Each cut, each stab, seemed methodical, almost too deliberate. This wasn’t a crime of passion or an act of desperation. No, this had been calculated.

His fingers traced the edge of one of the wounds carefully, as if reading a message in the jagged flesh. “Definitely not a random mugging,” he muttered under his breath. The victim had bled out quickly, but the series of lacerations suggested someone knew what they were doing—someone who took their time and enjoyed it.

He stood up and surveyed the scene, taking in the surroundings. The alley was narrow, barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. No signs of a struggle, no obvious footprints—just the rain, washing away the evidence like a guilty accomplice. He sighed.

One of the forensic technicians approached, handing him a small evidence bag. Inside was a crumpled piece of paper, folded neatly despite the chaos of the murder scene. Kenji took it and opened it carefully. The small card was damp but the message was still legible, written in a neat, almost clinical script.

*“This is just the beginning. The algorithm has spoken.”*

Kenji raised an eyebrow. “Well, isn’t that dramatic,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Someone’s clearly taken a class on flair. I wonder if they accept returns on these kinds of messages.”

He pocketed the note and turned back to the body, his mind racing. This wasn’t just about the victim—it was bigger. A tech entrepreneur with ties to some of the city’s shadiest political figures, lying dead in an alley, left with a cryptic note. Whoever had done this wanted attention. They wanted to send a message.

But who was the intended audience?

Kenji felt the weight of the rain pressing down on him as he considered his next move. The city hummed around him, indifferent to the life lost just a few feet away. Tokyo’s dark side had always been there, lurking beneath the surface, but this felt different. This wasn’t just about power or money—this felt like a game. And someone had just made the first move.

He lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he stared at the body. The victim’s face seemed to mock him, as if daring him to unravel the mystery that had been set into motion.

“Alright,” Kenji said quietly, flicking the cigarette into a nearby puddle. “Let’s see where this leads.”

He turned to one of the officers. “Get me everything you can on this guy. Business, personal, I want to know if his pet goldfish had enemies.”

The officer nodded and hurried off, leaving Kenji alone with his thoughts.

The rain had lessened to a steady drizzle, the rhythmic tapping on the pavement almost soothing in the quiet that followed. But Kenji couldn’t shake the feeling that something far more unsettling was coming. This wasn’t just another murder—it was the start of something much darker.

He glanced again at the note. “The algorithm has spoken.”

A chill crept up his spine, not from the cold, but from the realization that this was only the beginning.

As he turned to leave, his phone buzzed again. Another message. Another murder.

Kenji’s eyes narrowed as he read the details. Different location, same signature. The algorithm had indeed spoken.

And it wasn’t done yet.

He flicked the hood of his coat up and began to walk through the rain-soaked streets, the neon lights flickering ominously in the distance. Somewhere in the sprawling city, a killer was playing a game—one that Kenji was now a part of. But he wasn’t the type to back down from a challenge, especially not one that was as calculated, as cold, as this.

As he made his way back to the precinct, the city buzzed around him, oblivious to the storm that was brewing. Kenji could feel it in his gut: things were going to get worse before they got better.

And someone, somewhere, was counting on it.

The precinct was a sterile contrast to the gritty streets outside. Fluorescent lights hummed above, casting an unflattering glow over the rows of desks cluttered with paperwork, coffee cups, and the remnants of long shifts. Detective Kenji Nakamura entered, his coat still damp from the rain, the note from the crime scene crinkling in his pocket. The faint scent of cigarette smoke followed him in, blending with the stale office air.

He didn’t waste time exchanging pleasantries. It wasn’t in his nature. Walking past a few colleagues who gave him knowing nods, he headed straight for his desk. His mind was already racing through the possibilities as he flicked on his computer. With the note echoing in his mind—“The algorithm has spoken”— Kenji couldn't help but feel that this was more than just a string of murders. It was a challenge, a carefully orchestrated plan.

The crime scene photos of the tech entrepreneur popped up on his screen. Kenji leaned back in his chair, taking a moment to absorb the details again. The victim, a mid-level tech entrepreneur named Tatsuya Sato, had been involved in several high-profile tech ventures over the last few years. Most of them had failed spectacularly, but not without catching the attention of powerful people. People who wouldn’t mind seeing him out of the picture—if he’d made the wrong enemies, that is.

He grabbed a file from the growing pile on his desk. Inside was Sato’s background—his rise in the tech world, his shady investments, and his political ties. It didn’t take long for Kenji to connect the dots. The man had been in bed with some of Tokyo’s dirtiest politicians, the ones who pushed agendas in the shadows while pretending to fight for the public. Sato had known too much. And now, it seemed, someone had made sure he wouldn’t talk again.

Kenji tapped his fingers against the desk, his eyes narrowing. But it wasn’t the political connections that gnawed at him. It was the message. “The algorithm has spoken.” 
Whoever was behind this murder wanted to send a message, but it wasn’t just for the police or the public. No, this was something deeper. The way the wounds were precisely calculated, the cryptic note—everything about it screamed control. Precision.

Kenji’s phone buzzed again, this time with an incoming call. He recognized the number instantly—Lieutenant Ayumi Kato. She was sharp, no-nonsense, and didn’t appreciate Kenji’s penchant for sarcasm, but she respected his instincts.

“Kenji,” her voice came through, steady and calm as always, “we have another one.”

“Another body?” Kenji asked, already grabbing his coat.

“Same M.O.,” she confirmed. “It’s starting to feel like we’re in the middle of someone’s experiment. Same kind of victim. High profile, tech ties, and... there’s another message.”

Kenji didn’t need to hear more. The pattern was emerging faster than he had anticipated. Whoever was doing this was methodical, and there was no doubt that they were leading the police somewhere—where, exactly, was still unclear.

He hung up and made his way to the location, the rain once again greeting him as he stepped outside. The city loomed around him, indifferent to the violence that was unraveling beneath its polished surface. Kenji hailed a taxi, sliding into the back seat and giving the driver a quick nod. His thoughts churned, dissecting each detail of the case, looking for anything that stood out.

The second crime scene was in the more upscale part of the city, where towering skyscrapers and neon signs spoke of wealth and power. But even here, the rain had a way of making everything look grimier. As Kenji stepped out of the taxi, the slick pavement glistened under the streetlights, casting long shadows.

He ducked under the police tape once more, feeling a sense of déjà vu as he approached the body. This time, the victim was a well-known software developer—a pioneer in AI algorithms that had been making waves in Tokyo’s tech scene. His name was Hiroshi Tanaka, and just like the first victim, he was tied to certain influential people in the government. The type of people who operated behind closed doors and rarely stepped into the public eye.

Kenji approached the body. Tanaka lay slumped against the concrete wall of a narrow alley, his body twisted unnaturally. His eyes stared blankly ahead, and just like Sato, the wounds on his body were precise. Calculated. A chill ran down Kenji’s spine as he knelt beside the body, inspecting the wounds with the same meticulousness as before. Whoever was doing this had a plan—an algorithm, even. They weren’t killing randomly. Each move was part of something bigger.

Beside the body, just like before, a folded note sat neatly. Kenji picked it up and opened it, reading the message aloud to himself.

“Step two complete. The next move is inevitable.”

He crumpled the note in his hand, irritation and intrigue battling for dominance in his mind. This killer wasn’t just playing a game—they were showing off, as if they were taunting the police, daring them to keep up.

Kenji stood up, scanning the crime scene with renewed focus. This was no ordinary killer. This was someone who believed they were in control, someone who saw the world as a series of patterns and algorithms. The first victim had led to this one, and if the pattern held, the next victim was already chosen. But who? And why?

The growing number of questions gnawed at Kenji’s thoughts. As he made his way back to the precinct, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was missing something, some small but crucial detail that would unlock the whole puzzle. The rain had picked up again, drumming against the window of the taxi as he sat in silence, watching the city pass by in a blur of lights.

Back at the precinct, Kenji dove into the files on both victims. Sato and Tanaka were connected, not just through their tech ventures but through their involvement with a certain political figure—a rising star in the government with ambitions to regulate the tech industry, particularly in the realm of data privacy and AI development. This politician, Hideo Mori, had made waves recently by pushing for stricter controls over user data, something that hadn’t made him many friends in the tech world.

Kenji leaned back in his chair, a thought forming in his mind. Was this about the politics of data privacy? Or was it something deeper? The killer seemed to be targeting people who were directly involved in the tech world, people who had played a role in shaping the future of AI and algorithms. But why? What was the motive?

His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps approaching. Lieutenant Ayumi Kato stepped into the room, her expression as unreadable as always.

“You’ve seen the connections?” she asked, crossing her arms.

Kenji nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, but something still doesn’t add up. These murders... they feel too precise, too calculated. It’s almost like they’re not even about the victims themselves.”

Ayumi raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”

“I mean, whoever is behind this isn’t just killing people—they’re executing a plan. It’s like they’re following some kind of... formula. Each murder leads to the next one. It’s all connected, but we’re missing the bigger picture.”

Ayumi glanced at the crumpled note on Kenji’s desk. “You think it’s a game?”

Kenji shook his head. “No, not a game. More like a puzzle. And the killer’s playing both sides—us and them.”

Ayumi frowned, considering his words. “So what’s the next move?”

Kenji stared at the crime scene photos on his desk, his mind racing through the possibilities. The answer was out there, somewhere in the maze of data and bloodshed. He just had to find it.

“The next move,” Kenji muttered, “is figuring out who’s pulling the strings.”

And with that, the detective dove deeper into the web of conspiracies, tech secrets, and political games that would soon threaten to engulf the entire city. The algorithm had spoken, but its voice was far from finished.
